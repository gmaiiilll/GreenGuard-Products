## Expanding the Database

### Adding More Products

To add more products, edit `backend/app.py` and add entries to the `PRODUCTS` list:

```python
{
    "id": 11,
    "name": "Product Name",
    "manufacturer": "Manufacturer Name",
    "category": "Category",
    "subcategory": "Subcategory",
    "description": "Product description",
    "certifications": ["GreenGuard Gold", "Other Cert"],
    "voc_level": "Zero VOC" or "Very Low",
    "applications": ["Residential", "Commercial"],
    "supplier_contact": "www.supplier.com",
    "price_range": "$X-Y per unit",
    "installation_notes": "Installation details",
    "image_url": "/api/placeholder/400/300"
}
```

### Connecting to a Real Database

For production use, replace the in-memory `PRODUCTS` list with a real database:

1. **PostgreSQL** (recommended for production):
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy
```

2. **MongoDB** (good for flexible schemas):
```bash
pip install pymongo
```

3. Update `app.py` to connect to your database and query products

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment (Example: Heroku)

1. Create a `Procfile`:
```
web: python app.py
```

2. Update `app.py` to use environment port:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

### Frontend Deployment (Example: Vercel/Netlify)

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your hosting service

3. Update API URLs to point to your production backend
